# Salesforce Azure Dev Ops Demo

The following repository contains sample code and configuration to run a full end-to-end Salesforce release pipeline using Azure Dev Ops.

This implementation has been based on the great work done by [Stafford Williams](https://staffordwilliams.com/blog/2020/04/01/a-salesforce-pipeline-in-azure-devops-copy/) in his public blog post.

# Set Up

1. First fork the repo
2. Build a new pipeline in Azure DevOps 
3. Connect to your forked repo, and when choosing the project type, point to the yaml file inside
4. Install [SF Power Scripts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzlamSalam.sfpowerscripts&ssr=false#review-details) extension into your Azure DevOps instance.

# To Do

There's a few oustanding to-dos:
- Turn repo into a template

# Warranties et al.

Made with love. Use with care. No warranties, etc.
