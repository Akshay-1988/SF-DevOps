# Salesforce Azure Dev Ops Demo

The following repository contains sample code and configuration to run a full end-to-end Salesforce release pipeline using Azure Dev Ops.

This implementation has been based on the great work done by [Stafford Williams](https://staffordwilliams.com/blog/2020/04/01/a-salesforce-pipeline-in-azure-devops-copy/) in his public blog post.

# Set Up
To get this working, you'll need to first fork the repo, then build a new pipeline in Azure DevOps. While you do so, connect to your forked repo, and when choosing the project type, point to the yaml file within.

# To Do

There's a few oustanding to-dos:
- Turn repo into a template

# Warranties et al.

Made with love. Use with care. No warranties, etc.
